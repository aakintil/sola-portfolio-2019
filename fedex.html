                The original Powerpad was a game changer for Fedex, allowing their couriers use to scan, track, and
                deliver pacakges. However, it was developed and designed around constraints and biases that are no
                longer valid. Built in a monolithic fashion using Windows Forms, the system followed rigid linear paths,
                constricting employees and forcing them to follow workflows that blocked them from performing specific
                tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="section-overview-content">
                As the UX Designer on the project, I worked on the Smartpad, the improved version of the Powerpad.
                Rather than scrap the entire system, we started small and proposed rolling out the solution in phases.
                Focusing our efforts First-Overnight Couriers was key to our process. FO couriers are the low-volume,
                delivery-only couriers, that ensure your packages arrive before 8am.
            </p>

            <p class="section-overview-content">
                We gathered feedback about couriers' negative experiences with the existing Powerpad. After sitting
                through stakeholder meetings, and ensuring that we understood all the existing requirements in a
                workflow, we sat down to craft simpler and more efficient ways to allow couriers do their jobs.
                Afterwards, we would go back to the same couriers in order to validate our proposed solutions,
                interacting with them as they used the system in different delivery scenarios. It was integral that we
                validated our solutions so that Fedex would not spend insane amounts of money and waste time launching a
                product that would not work.
