            Cigna Health realized that there customers had a difficult time understanding and navigating their provider
            benefits during their healthcare journey. They needed to provide their customers with answers, before they
            had questions, with solutions before they realized there was a problem.

            As the Senior UX Designer, my task was to craft a “sensing” experience around integrated messaging and
            virtual assistance, an extension of their OneGuide platform. Working with Citizen Plus and Cigna Health, we
            provided Cigna customers with contextual guidance anticipated their needs, and relevant resources, during
            their healthcare journey.

            Interacting and interviewing over 40 patients suffering from musculoskeletal back-pain with various health
            care providers, led us to understand their situations and possible touch-points based on available provider
            data. With the improved OneGuide experience, participants saw their needs being met. They were offered
            less-expensive alternate medications, reminders about their physical, mental, and massage therapy beneifts,
            and resources to help them prep for surgery.
