                As the Senior UX Designer, my task was to craft a “sensing” experience around integrated messaging and
                virtual assistance. Working with Citizen Plus and Cigna Health, the goal was to provide Cigna customers
                with contextual guidance and anticipate their needs, during their healthcare journey. I assisted in user
                research, lead concept definition workshops, performed group validation, and other methods to inform my
                decisions and design direction. My focus was on four primary scenarios, crafted out of the research
                findings: Finding Care and Anticipating Costs, Exploring Treatment Options and Coverage, Getting the
                Most out of Provider Appointments, and Recovering from an Event. Interacting and interviewing over 40
                patients suffering from musculoskeletal back-pain with various health care providers, led us to
                understand their situations and possible touch-points based on available provider data.
