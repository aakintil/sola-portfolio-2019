        Problem
        Cigna Health realized that there customers had a difficult time understanding and navigating their provider benefits during their healthcare journey. They needed to provide their customers with answers, before they had questions, with solutions before they realized there was a problem. 

        Solution
        As the Senior UX Designer, my task was to craft a “sensing” experience around integrated messaging and
        virtual assistance, an extension of their OneGuide platform. Working with Citizen Plus and Cigna Health, we provided Cigna customers with contextual guidance anticipated their needs, and relevant resources, during their healthcare journey.

        Result / impact 
        Interacting and interviewing over 40 patients suffering from musculoskeletal back-pain with various health care providers, led us to understand their situations and possible touch-points based on available provider data. With the improved OneGuide experience, participants saw their needs being met. They were offered less-expensive alternate medications, reminders about their physical, mental, and massage therapy beneifts, and resources to help them prep for surgery.

            with contextual guidance and anticipate their needs, during their healthcare journey. I assisted in user
            research, lead concept definition workshops, performed group validation, and other methods to inform my
            decisions and design direction. My focus was on four primary scenarios, crafted out of the research
            findings: Finding Care and Anticipating Costs, Exploring Treatment Options and Coverage, Getting the
            Most out of Provider Appointments, and Recovering from an Event. Interacting and interviewing over 40
            patients suffering from musculoskeletal back-pain with various health care providers, led us to
            understand their situations and possible touch-points based on available provider data.
